To make the cut, we look for companies that pay reliable dividends. Why? Because we recognize how dividends have accounted for 40% of stock market returns since 1930 and during decades of inflation (like we’re in now), it’s a whopping 54%.\\nTo help you make the most of your subscription, here are some quick guides to the advisory to help you  put it to work for you right away:\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true},\"insert\":\"Download our \"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"\",\"link\":\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/forbes-billionaire-investor/files/2022/633b27c4432d6b9cf678b215/FBI_october22.pdf\"},\"insert\":\"23-page Inaugural Issue\"},{\"insert\":\".
