My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis.

I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
                    810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
                    075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
                    340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
                    620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
                    820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
                    590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
                    750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
                    710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it. Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in additional shares of stock at the time they are paid. </p><p><strong>Benchmark Performance/Fill Gaps</strong></p><p>With the model portfolio each week, you will also receive a roundup of market activity that includes weekly and year-to-date performance of broad range of market benchmarks represented by exchange-traded funds. I present this information, along with dividend yields of the ETFs, to show you which sectors and styles are performing well, and which are laggards. </p><p>I also offer a specific look into the equity income universe represented by ETFs that track dividend growth stocks, small and midcap dividend payers, master limited partnerships, business development companies, and international dividend stocks. Along with the ETFs, I include a handful of dividend mutual funds and the FDI portfolio in the weekly rankings. </p><p>In addition to providing a useful comparison of our performance to other dividend strategies, you should also consider using some of these ETFs to tap into parts of the market that may be underrepresented in your portfolio. I believe that the best use of the stocks I present in the FDI portfolio is to supplement your existing holdings. I do make sure that these stocks can keep on paying and hiking their dividends, and that they are cheap relative to history.</p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the newsletter, how to use it, or the stocks presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it. Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in additional shares of stock at the time they are paid. </p><p><strong>Benchmark Performance/Fill Gaps</strong></p><p>With the model portfolio each week, you will also receive a roundup of market activity that includes weekly and year-to-date performance of broad range of market benchmarks represented by exchange-traded funds. I present this information, along with dividend yields of the ETFs, to show you which sectors and styles are performing well, and which are laggards. </p><p>I also offer a specific look into the equity income universe represented by ETFs that track dividend growth stocks, small and midcap dividend payers, master limited partnerships, business development companies, and international dividend stocks.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they've spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. We also issue updates throughout the month on those recommendations with noteworthy developments or that have moved significantly in price (up or down) on such news, which provide additional insight on these existing positions.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbes-investor/2011/11/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-investor/?sh=510e58bb6661" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbes-investor/2011/11/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-investor/?sh=510e58bb6661"><strong>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here.</strong></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    description: "<p>I am the chief investment officer of Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors LLC and editor of Forbes/Fridson Income Securities Investor. I have written six books on finance and political economy. My work has appeared in Barron's, the Financial Times, and numerous professional periodicals such as Financial Analysts Journal and the Journal of Portfolio Management. While working at Merrill Lynch I was named top high yield bond strategist for nine consecutive years in Institutional Investor's All America Research survey. Investment Dealers Digest has described me as "perhaps the most well-known figure in the high yield world.” The Financial Management Association International named me the Financial Executive of the Year in 2002. In 2000, I became the youngest person ever inducted into the Fixed Income Analysts Society Hall of Fame. The Boston Globe said my 2006 book, Unwarranted Intrusions: The Case Against Government Intervention in the Marketplace, should be short-listed for best business book of the decade.</p>",

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…

810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,

    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed.

    Dr. Shilling is well known for his forecasting record. In the spring of 1969, he was among the few who correctly saw that a recession would start late in the year.

In the late 1970s, when most thought that raging inflation would last forever, he was the first to predict that the changing political mood of the country would lead to an end of severe inflation, as well as to potentially serious financial and economic readjustment problems, and a shift in investment strategy from one favoring tangible assets to an emphasis on stocks and bonds.</p><p><br></p><p> 
    Shilling received his bachelor's degree in physics, magna cum laude, from Amherst College, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired.

One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the <i>Forbes Dividend Investor</i> newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of <i>Forbes Premium Income Report</i> I recommend income-generating options trades. <p><p>
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched <i>Forbes Stock of the Week</i> and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and <i>Inc</i>. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.<p><p>
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> has proven to be a grand–slam winner with… <p><p>
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade<br>
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade<br>
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade<br>
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch trade<br>
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo &amp; Co trade<br>
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade<br>
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade<br>
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade<br><p><p>
    
    These are actual <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> trades. <p><p>
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate! <p><p>
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.<p><p>
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.<p><p>
    
    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    <p><p>
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.  <p><p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service.

Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"The Buy Write: "},{"insert":"The bulk of our trades are "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"buy writes"},{"insert":": buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. \nOwning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Selling Puts: "},{"insert":"A less frequent part of our repertoire is "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"selling cash-secured puts"},{"insert":", which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Credit Spreads: "},{"insert":"From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “"},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread"},"insert":"bull put spread"},{"insert":",” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"After Expiration: "},{"insert":"With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Investor",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the <i>Forbes Dividend Investor</i> newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of <i>Forbes Premium Income Report</i> I recommend income-generating options trades. <p><p>
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched <i>Forbes Stock of the Week</i> and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and <i>Inc</i>. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.<p><p>

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it. Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in additional shares of stock at the time they are paid. </p><p><strong>Benchmark Performance/Fill Gaps</strong></p><p>With the model portfolio each week, you will also receive a roundup of market activity that includes weekly and year-to-date performance of broad range of market benchmarks represented by exchange-traded funds. I present this information, along with dividend yields of the ETFs, to show you which sectors and styles are performing well, and which are laggards. </p><p>I also offer a specific look into the equity income universe represented by ETFs that track dividend growth stocks, small and midcap dividend payers, master limited partnerships, business development companies, and international dividend stocks. Along with the ETFs, I include a handful of dividend mutual funds and the FDI portfolio in the weekly rankings. </p><p>In addition to providing a useful comparison of our performance to other dividend strategies, you should also consider using some of these ETFs to tap into parts of the market that may be underrepresented in your portfolio. I believe that the best use of the stocks I present in the FDI portfolio is to supplement your existing holdings. I do make sure that these stocks can keep on paying and hiking their dividends, and that they are cheap relative to history.</p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the newsletter, how to use it, or the stocks presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

An active trader of his own account, he also manages option-oriented accounts for clients. In a research capacity, he edits and contributes to his firm’s publications: <em>Daily Volume Alerts</em>, <em>The Option Strategist</em> and <em>The Daily Strategist</em> – derivative products newsletters covering equity, index, and futures options.  In these capacities, he is the president of McMillan Analysis Corporation, which he founded in 1991. Prior to founding his own firm, McMillan was a proprietary trader at two major brokerage firms – primarily Thomson McKinnon Securities, where he ran the Equity Arbitrage Department for nine years. McMillan was the recipient of the Sullivan Award for 2011, awarded by the Options Industry Council in recognition of his contributions to the Options Industry.</p>",

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the <i>Forbes Dividend Investor</i> newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of <i>Forbes Premium Income Report</i> I recommend income-generating options trades. <p><p>
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched <i>Forbes Stock of the Week</i> and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and <i>Inc</i>. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.<p><p>
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> has proven to be a grand–slam winner with… <p><p>
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade<br>
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade<br>
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade<br>
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch trade<br>
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo &amp; Co trade<br>
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade<br>
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade<br>
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade<br><p><p>
    
    These are actual <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> trades. <p><p>
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate! <p><p>
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.<p><p>
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.<p><p>
    
    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    <p><p>
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.  <p><p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"The Buy Write: "},{"insert":"The bulk of our trades are "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"buy writes"},{"insert":": buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. \nOwning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Selling Puts: "},{"insert":"A less frequent part of our repertoire is "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"selling cash-secured puts"},{"insert":", which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Credit Spreads: "},{"insert":"From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “"},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread"},"insert":"bull put spread"},{"insert":",” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"After Expiration: "},{"insert":"With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Tracking Trades: "},{"insert":"At the end of every trading day, I update the "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"FPIR Master Trade Log"},{"insert":" on "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing"},"insert":"this Google Sheet which I share with members"},{"insert":".

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Special Situation Survey",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service. This is a commitment we take seriously. So much so that I make myself available to help answer any subscriber questions.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Tracking Trades: "},{"insert":"At the end of every trading day, I update the "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"FPIR Master Trade Log"},{"insert":" on "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing"},"insert":"this Google Sheet which I share with members"},{"insert":".

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…

    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it.

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Special Situation Survey",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,

    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.

    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration.

Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the <i>Forbes Dividend Investor</i> newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of <i>Forbes Premium Income Report</i> I recommend income-generating options trades. <p><p>
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched <i>Forbes Stock of the Week</i> and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and <i>Inc</i>. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.<p><p>
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> has proven to be a grand–slam winner with… <p><p>
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade<br>
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade<br>
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade<br>
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch trade<br>
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo &amp; Co trade<br>
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade<br>
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade<br>
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade<br><p><p>
    
    These are actual <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> trades. <p><p>
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate! <p><p>
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.<p><p>
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.<p><p>
    
    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    <p><p>
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.  <p><p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"The Buy Write: "},{"insert":"The bulk of our trades are "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"buy writes"},{"insert":": buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. \nOwning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Selling Puts: "},{"insert":"A less frequent part of our repertoire is "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"selling cash-secured puts"},{"insert":", which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold.

This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"After Expiration: "},{"insert":"With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Investor",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it. Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in additional shares of stock at the time they are paid. </p><p><strong>Benchmark Performance/Fill Gaps</strong></p><p>With the model portfolio each week, you will also receive a roundup of market activity that includes weekly and year-to-date performance of broad range of market benchmarks represented by exchange-traded funds. I present this information, along with dividend yields of the ETFs, to show you which sectors and styles are performing well, and which are laggards. </p><p>I also offer a specific look into the equity income universe represented by ETFs that track dividend growth stocks, small and midcap dividend payers, master limited partnerships, business development companies, and international dividend stocks. Along with the ETFs, I include a handful of dividend mutual funds and the FDI portfolio in the weekly rankings. </p><p>In addition to providing a useful comparison of our performance to other dividend strategies, you should also consider using some of these ETFs to tap into parts of the market that may be underrepresented in your portfolio. I believe that the best use of the stocks I present in the FDI portfolio is to supplement your existing holdings. I do make sure that these stocks can keep on paying and hiking their dividends, and that they are cheap relative to history.</p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the newsletter, how to use it, or the stocks presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,

    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.

    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options.

    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration.

Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices.

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…

810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,

    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>.

    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration.

Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions.

There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it.

My investment advice can be found in Forbes Investor and Forbes Special Situation Survey – the two longest running investment newsletters currently published by Forbes Media LLC – for which I serve as editor.  Having joined Forbes in January 2000 as an equity analyst, I’ve gained over a decade of experience analyzing equities across multiple sectors and industries.  I also served as the associate editor of the Forbes Investor from June 2004 to July 2010.  I earned a B.S. in Marketing and International Business from the Stern School of Business at New York University and hold the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.  My stock selections from the Forbes Investor have been featured on Forbes.com, Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, Seeking Alpha, the Money Show and the Dick Davis Digest.",

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

    description: "<p>I have more than 25 years of experience in commercial real estate where I have formulated a deep understanding of valuation analysis. My experience is rooted in wealth creation as I spent almost two decades as a developer assisting many national retailers with expansion while simultaneously learning the real estate trade literally from the ground up.
    Over the years, I have provided nationwide real estate brokerage, construction services, development services and capital market solutions for a variety of clients. Because of my integrated background, I have vast resources that could not be learned at any business school. Today I research and write on a variety of real estate based income alternatives, including publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies. Given my background in sourcing and originating income producing assets, I have gained broad experience and understanding in capital markets and evaluating the most intelligent companies—with a keen eye on “distinguishing between an investment operation and speculative one.”
    I currently write for Forbes.com and Seeking Alpha and I am the editor of Forbes Real Estate Investor. I also wrote <em>The Trump Factor</em> and co-authored <em>The Intelligent REIT  Investor</em> with Stephanie Krewson-Kelly. I have been featured in Kiplinger’s, U.S. News &amp; World Report, Money, NPR, Institutional Investor, GlobeStreet and Fox Business. I was ranked as the #1 analyst on Seeking Alpha in 2014. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in business/economics from Presbyterian College where I played basketball.</p>",

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…

810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,

710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one.

Let me briefly touch upon each point here.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Stock Selection Philosophy"},{"insert":"\nA company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few \"special situations\" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.\n"

"insert": "\nWhile there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.\nI strongly believe these two factors set the "

As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.\nThat's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).\n"

"insert": "\nThis is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.\nHowever, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.\nThere are probably a few other questions you may have.

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.

    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard.

Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Dividend Investor",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>I wanted to send you a note of thanks and to welcome you as a member of <strong><em>Forbes Dividend Investor (FDI)</em></strong>, which provides you weekly issues of the newsletter, and access to the FDI model portfolio with notifications of changes when they are made. </p><p><strong>Following the FDI Portfolio </strong></p><p>Stocks presented each week in the FDI portfolio are ranked from most to least attractive based on a screening model that seeks out stocks trading at discounts to historical valuations, based on multiples of price to sales, earnings, cash flow, and book value, as well as enterprise value/earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization. Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions. If a stock closes 10% or more below its highest close since you have owned it, you should consider selling it, unless there is a compelling reason to keep it, which could include new insider buying, technical support on the chart, or an upcoming dividend.</p><p>Portfolio deletions and additions are highlighted each week. There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it. Dividends are assumed to be reinvested in additional shares of stock at the time they are paid. </p><p><strong>Benchmark Performance/Fill Gaps</strong></p><p>With the model portfolio each week, you will also receive a roundup of market activity that includes weekly and year-to-date performance of broad range of market benchmarks represented by exchange-traded funds. I present this information, along with dividend yields of the ETFs, to show you which sectors and styles are performing well, and which are laggards. </p><p>I also offer a specific look into the equity income universe represented by ETFs that track dividend growth stocks, small and midcap dividend payers, master limited partnerships, business development companies, and international dividend stocks. Along with the ETFs, I include a handful of dividend mutual funds and the FDI portfolio in the weekly rankings. </p><p>In addition to providing a useful comparison of our performance to other dividend strategies, you should also consider using some of these ETFs to tap into parts of the market that may be underrepresented in your portfolio. I believe that the best use of the stocks I present in the FDI portfolio is to supplement your existing holdings. I do make sure that these stocks can keep on paying and hiking their dividends, and that they are cheap relative to history.</p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the newsletter, how to use it, or the stocks presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. \nBut finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. \nTo borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"The Tortoise Stock"},{"insert":"\nThe market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"The Hare Stock"},{"insert":"\nShares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.\nThis dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the "},{"attributes":{"italic":true,"bold":true},"insert":"Forbes Investor"},{"insert":" apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available. And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today. Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result. This has and will always be our goal. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Where to Start"},{"insert":"\nOf course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Special Situation Survey",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Special Situation Survey",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard.

Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Selling Puts: "},{"insert":"A less frequent part of our repertoire is "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4"},"insert":"selling cash-secured puts"},{"insert":", which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Credit Spreads: "},{"insert":"From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “"},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread"},"insert":"bull put spread"},{"insert":",” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. \n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"After Expiration: "},{"insert":"With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Tracking Trades: "},{"insert":"At the end of every trading day, I update the "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"FPIR Master Trade Log"},{"insert":" on "},{"attributes":{"color":"","link":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing"},"insert":"this Google Sheet which I share with members"},{"insert":".

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Special Situation Survey",
    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking experience. But it can also be a rewarding one. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service with both a sound philosophy behind selecting stocks and a unique approach to valuing these selections. Let me briefly touch upon each point here.</p><p><strong>Stock Selection Philosophy</strong></p><p>A company's stock can fall out of favor for many reasons. In most instances, the concerns driving this are legitimate. We comb for the few "special situations" in which that's not the case. These special situations can result from numerous factors—the missing of quarterly expectations due to the ill effects of a temporary headwind that a company should or may already be getting over, exaggerated fears over the loss of a major customer, or a slower–than–anticipated payoff from a key acquisition, just to name a few. Each of our recommendations present a unique story of such misfortunes that led to the downward spiral in a company's share value, offers a compelling argument as to why it is undeserving of the selloff it's endured and, most importantly, why we expect it to be trading significantly higher ahead.</p><p><strong>Unique Valuation Approach</strong></p><p>While there are many ways to derive the value of a stock, what's common to all of them is the fact that they're only as good as the assumptions they employ. Even slight variations in the expectations for sales growth or profit margins can lead to widely differing valuations using the same methodology. But trying to forecast what the future holds isn't easy. And even the best analysts often get it wrong. That's why our approach is to try to be as conservative as possible when valuing a stock while still maintaining a realistic picture of what may lie ahead. In my view, being able to justify a company's stock as deeply undervalued even after lowballing what you actually think the firm will achieve from an operational standpoint provides greater confidence in any valuation analysis.</p><p>I strongly believe these two factors set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the from the swathe of other investment advice services available today. Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of which recommendations should you buy? As we only recommend one new stock a month, I understand that waiting for the first one to drop may not satisfy those looking to build a portfolio quickly.</p><p>That's where our reviews come in. Specifically, we post reviews on all our existing recommendations after any major news or quarterly earnings. All these individual reviews end with a clear assessment of what we think the stock is currently worth. And for your convenience, there is a table at the end of every Monthly Recap that lists these latest valuations for our open positions, as well as how much upside this implies relative to their current market price. Just remember that there's always a tradeoff between risk and return. Thus, my advice would be to spread your purchases among as many positions as you can rather than simply focusing on those that offer the most upside (since they likely also carry the most risk).</p><p><strong>As a new subscriber which stocks should I buy first?</strong></p><p>This is probably the most common question asked by new subscribers. For those with a limited amount of funds to invest or who simply want to take things slow, my advice is to buy the stocks that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the stock that is recommended with your first issue, then the following month, and so on. Your portfolio will grow quicker than you think.</p><p>However, for subscribers that desire a larger starting portfolio, I would also look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they have spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. Moreover, as noted above, we provide updated opinions on all open recommendations. Thus, any decision to invest in older positions should be based on our latest reviews on those stocks. Even then, you should use good judgment. For example, if a stock has run up another 20% since our most recent review, it may be better to wait until our next update before taking any action.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/sss/2012/10/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-special-situation-survey/?sh=6ddf4e13dbfd"><strong><u>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here</u></strong><u>. </u></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Special Situation Survey</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service.

Besides Forbes, his articles appear in The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and The <em>New York Times</em>, among others. He is a member of The Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Economic Journal) Board of Economists and appears frequently on radio and television business shows. Recognized as an effective and dynamic speaker, he often addresses national and international conventions of various business groups, including the Young Presidents Organization.</p><p><br></p><p>
    Dr. Shilling is well known for his forecasting record. In the spring of 1969, he was among the few who correctly saw that a recession would start late in the year. In 1973, he stood almost alone in forecasting that the world was entering a massive inventory-building spree to be followed by the first major worldwide recession since the 1930s. In the late 1970s, when most thought that raging inflation would last forever, he was the first to predict that the changing political mood of the country would lead to an end of severe inflation, as well as to potentially serious financial and economic readjustment problems, and a shift in investment strategy from one favoring tangible assets to an emphasis on stocks and bonds.</p><p><br></p><p> 
    Shilling received his bachelor's degree in physics, magna cum laude, from Amherst College, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. Earlier, Shilling earned his master’s degree and doctorate in economics at Stanford University. While on the West Coast, he served on the staffs of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Bank of America. Before establishing his own firm in 1978, Dr. Shilling was senior vice president and chief economist of White, Weld &amp; Co. Earlier, he set up the Economics Department at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith and served as the firm’s first chief economist. Prior to Merrill Lynch, he was with Standard Oil Co. (N.J.) (now Exxon), where he was in charge of U.S. and Canadian economic analysis and forecasting.</p>",

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…

810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,

    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.

    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow.

    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration.

Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices.

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I recommend income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week.
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk.
    
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.",

    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate! <p><p>
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.<p><p>
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.<p><p>
    
    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.
    <p><p>
    
    Now it's your turn to see for yourself the kind of cash <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.  <p><p>",

Companies need to have more than ample free cash flow to maintain and raise the dividend. I also give strong consideration to buying and selling activity by company insiders. </p><p>My goal with the portfolio is to produce an exceptional level of current income via dividends, with total return that is competitive with or superior to other equity income strategies. Dividend yields in the FDI portfolio are all at least double the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, and often more than four times as high.</p><p>Ideally you could hold these stocks forever, but I do recommend using a 10% trailing stop loss on all positions.

There may be times when a stock has violated a 10% stop in the FDI portfolio but not in your own portfolio, in which case you should observe a 10% stop from the highest close during your holding period. </p><p>FDI portfolio performance is calculated by averaging the total return of each of the stocks in it.

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    description: "Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the <i>Forbes Dividend Investor</i> newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually averaging 4.5%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of <i>Forbes Premium Income Report</i> I recommend income-generating options trades. <p><p>
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched <i>Forbes Stock of the Week</i> and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis.

    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired.

One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period.

    body: "<p>I'm very pleased to have you as part of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;community. Whether you're just embarking on your investing endeavor or are a seasoned pro with years of experience, buying stocks can be a nerve-racking. And that’s without so many market headwinds—such as sky-high inflation, sharply rising interest rates, ongoing global supply-chain woes, and, of course, the war in Ukraine—creating the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </p><p>But finding stocks that will do well under such challenging market conditions also makes for a more rewarding experience in my view. Our goal is to help contribute to the latter by providing a service primarily focused on identifying unappreciated stocks that are priced for value but offer enough profit growth potential to help them outperform the market over the next 6–18 months. </p><p>To borrow the title from a famous fable, our stocks generally fall into two categories, which I refer to as the Tortoise and the Hare.</p><p><strong>The Tortoise Stock</strong></p><p>The market tends to place a premium on shares of companies that have enjoyed solid, consistent earnings growth in recent years and continue to have fundamentally strong growth prospects over the longer term. The Tortoise stock is one that enjoyed such a premium but has recently sold off and become significantly undervalued due to an overreaction to what we view as temporary factors. Once these headwinds—which they may already be in the midst of recovering from—pass, we expect these stocks to return to growing at above-average rates in a steady manner and move back up towards the higher valuations they once commanded.</p><p><strong>The Hare Stock</strong></p><p>Shares of some companies sell at greatly depressed levels due to a recent history of poor earnings performance or other operational issues that have investors staying away. Most aren't worth a second look. But the Hare stock is the exception. Through the successful execution of a bold operational turnaround plan or an ambitious business transformation strategy—which in most cases have started to bear fruit—these companies have positioned themselves to realize a substantial rebound in earnings over the near term that's strong enough to finally lift their shares out of the doldrums and materially outperform the overall market over a short span.</p><p>This dual approach to finding undervalued stocks is also presented in a rolling portfolio that is designed to reduce risk through diversification. When taken together, I sincerely believe these factors help set the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;apart from the swathe of other investment advice services available.&nbsp;And that’s even truer right now when you consider than the steep selloff in the market this year has actually created a situation where so many stocks can be considered “undervalued” today.&nbsp;Indeed, it’s not enough to find ones that have been simply undeserving of their slides, they also have to have the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming months as a result.&nbsp;This has and will always be our goal. </p><p><strong>Where to Start</strong></p><p>Of course, this leads to the inevitable question of where and how to get started. More specifically, which stocks should you buy first? The easy answer is to simply purchase those that are recommended during your subscription period. That is, start with the two recommendations in your first month, then the two the following month, and so on. While this may seem slow, you'll be surprised by how quickly your portfolio will grow. However, for those that desire a larger starting portfolio, my advice would be to look at the stocks recommended in the most recent past issues. Unless they've spiked substantially since they were initially recommended, they should still offer plenty of value. We also issue updates throughout the month on those recommendations with noteworthy developments or that have moved significantly in price (up or down) on such news, which provide additional insight on these existing positions.</p><p>There are probably a few other questions you may have. <a href="https: //www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbes-investor/2011/11/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-investor/?sh=510e58bb6661" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/newsletters/forbes-investor/2011/11/01/how-to-get-started-using-the-forbes-investor/?sh=510e58bb6661"><strong>That's why we also provide a&nbsp;Getting Started&nbsp;link on our website that answers the most common questions our new subscribers often ask and goes into greater detail on the topics covered here.</strong></a></p><p>What's more, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;team and I are committed to providing you with all the information necessary for you to get the most out of our service. This is a commitment we take seriously. So much so that I make myself available to help answer any questions you may have regarding our service. Feel free to contact me directly via e–mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tyoon@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:tyoon@forbes.com"><strong>tyoon@forbes.com</strong></a>.</p><p>Again, thank you for joining the&nbsp;<strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong>&nbsp;community. I'm looking forward to helping you invest profitably and enjoy substantially higher returns versus the overall market in the months to come!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Taesik Yoon, CFA, </p><p>Editor, <strong><em>Forbes Investor</em></strong></p><p><em>Taesik Yoon&nbsp;is a financial editor with a proven track record of identifying stocks that significantly outperform the market.

    description: "<p>I am the chief investment officer of Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors LLC and editor of Forbes/Fridson Income Securities Investor. I have written six books on finance and political economy. My work has appeared in Barron's, the Financial Times, and numerous professional periodicals such as Financial Analysts Journal and the Journal of Portfolio Management. While working at Merrill Lynch I was named top high yield bond strategist for nine consecutive years in Institutional Investor's All America Research survey. Investment Dealers Digest has described me as "perhaps the most well-known figure in the high yield world.” The Financial Management Association International named me the Financial Executive of the Year in 2002. In 2000, I became the youngest person ever inducted into the Fixed Income Analysts Society Hall of Fame. The Boston Globe said my 2006 book, Unwarranted Intrusions: The Case Against Government Intervention in the Marketplace, should be short-listed for best business book of the decade.</p>",

    description: "<p>Not a day passes that I don’t scour the market for opportunities in stocks and equity options. As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.
    
    Forbes Premium Income Report invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday. We make our money by selling call and put options on these investments.
    
    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> invests in quality stocks only—stocks that we don't mind owning in the first place. As a member, you get two exceptional investments every Tuesday and Thursday—one conservative and one aggressive—a total of 4 opportunities a week. <p><p>
    
    You can invest in as many or as few as you want. Each pick is rigorously scrutinized by the well–respected Forbes team and ranked by risk. <p><p>
    Conservative stocks are companies that pay dividends reliably over a long timeframe. Aggressive stocks are usually companies with a strong growth profile. Quite simply, we make our money by selling call and put options on these investments. <p><p>
    
    Join our service today and you'll start collecting cash payment up to four times a month. 
    
    Our Founding Members who joined us last year would agree. All of them started by simply accepting our 30–day risk–free Founding Member offer.

    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

As editor of the Forbes Dividend Investor newsletter service, I send out new rankings every Friday with the best 25 current buys. These stocks have safe and generous yields, usually near 4%. My picks have beaten the market since I started sending them out in July 2012. On Tuesday and Thursday, as editor of Forbes Premium Income Report I send out two income-generating options trades.
    Outside of newsletters, I'm also responsible for money and investing coverage on Forbes.com. In 2003 I launched Forbes Stock of the Week and made more than 350 picks through 2010 based on fundamental and technical analysis. I’ve been at Forbes since 2001, originally coming here to do e-learning. I spent five years with CNN Financial News working with Lou Dobbs, where I produced long-form pieces and reported on management, entrepreneurship and financial markets. I've also worked at Bloomberg TV and Inc. magazine. I’m a native Floridian and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor of science degree in finance.
    
    Three years ago we introduced a breakthrough advisory for options investors and Forbes Premium Income Report has proven to be a grand–slam winner with…
    
    • $10,
810 on an Aetna trade
    • $8,
075 on a Valero Energy trade
    • $6,
340 on a Gilead Sciences trade
    • $4,
620 on an Abercrombie & Fitch trade
    • $4,
820 on a Wells Fargo & Co trade
    • $3,
590 on a Hi–Crush Partners LP trade
    • $2,
750 on an Expedia trade
    • $2,
710 on a Facebook trade
    
    These are actual Forbes Premium Income Report trades.
    
    In 2016, we made money on 111 out of 112 closed trades. That's more than a 99% success rate!
    
    The results have exceeded our highest expectations and have made a real difference in the financial success of our subscribers.
    
    But you haven't been with us to enjoy this phenomenal success. Today, I want to change that. To celebrate our market–stomping gains, we've decided to reopen our Founding Member offer for a very limited time.

    See for yourself the kind of cash Forbes Premium Income Report can bring you without risking a dime. If, after exploring the service for a month, you decide it's not for you, simply let us know and we'll refund the entire balance of your subscription. No hassles, no questions asked.</p>",

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price.

    title: "Welcome To Forbes Premium Income Report",
    body: "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href="https: //www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread" rel="nofollow noopener">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4" rel="nofollow noopener">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",
