                    "body": "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href=\"https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href=\"mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com\">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>).

This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \\nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. \\nWith 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period.

                    "body": "<p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you aboard as a <em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em> member. As you join our quest for income and total return by selling options on dividend-paying stocks, you will find some helpful tips below on how to make the most of the service. We have enjoyed great success since we started this service more than eight years ago, and I am confident that you will enjoy and profit from your membership. </p><p><strong>What Happens Now: </strong>Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, you will receive email notifications of new trades. You can also receive free text message notifications of new trades <a href=\"https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.mobilepages.co/6959/fpiroptinpage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u>by clicking here to sign up</u></a> with your mobile number. I publish two new trades on both days. In each recommendation, I provide explicit instructions on trade specifics, as well as fundamental data on why the underlying stock is worth owning. </p><p>We are trying to generate income and short-term capital gains in <strong><em>Forbes Premium Income Report</em></strong>. Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.</p><p><strong>The Buy Write: </strong>The bulk of our trades are <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">buy writes</a>: buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. </p><p>Owning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selling Puts: </strong>A less frequent part of our repertoire is <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">selling cash-secured puts</a>, which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. </p><p><strong>Credit Spreads: </strong>From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “<a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bull put spread</a>,” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. </p><p><strong>After Expiration: </strong>With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire. When this happens, I immediately look for advantageous times to <a href=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">write covered calls</a>, and send out recommendations with suggested limit prices. When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid.&nbsp;</p><p>We end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired. Nonetheless, we also have had some real Lazarus-like stocks that rose from the dead to become superstars, especially from the energy sector, which went from ice-cold to white-hot in the past two years. </p><p>With 16 trades per month, liquidity can become an issue with a lot of open positions. One way to raise cash is to sell the stock after the initial period during which you were short the options. This could still provide decent gains when you get assigned, and keep any losses limited, unless something causes a stock to crash before the options expire. I try to avoid that by avoiding earnings release for the initial buy write or put write period. Another way to go is to take partial profits when you have them.</p><p><strong>Tracking Trades: </strong>At the end of every trading day, I update the <strong>FPIR Master Trade Log</strong> on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q86s9_jxIEFNae5aeRt26IsP7exCrrWPFkORyOTJooA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this Google Sheet which I share with members</a>. You’ll see total returns and cost basis of previous trades, with links to the write-ups. </p><p>The FPIR Master Trade log has three tabs: Open Positions shows stocks we still own, with those on which we have short options positions shaded in yellow. Closed Trades shows completely closed out positions in which we no longer own the stock or have any options position. ‘Spreads’ shows you the results of spread trades, with active trades shaded yellow. </p><p><strong>Always Here to Help</strong></p><p>If you have questions about the service, how to use it, or the stocks and trades presented, please contact me anytime via email: John Dobosz (<a href=\"mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"color-link\" title=\"mailto:jdobosz@forbes.com\">jdobosz@forbes.com</a>). If you would like to speak on the phone or to connect via Zoom, just let me know. I cannot provide you with personal financial advice, but I can explain how to place the trades, and the implications of employing the strategies we use. Most major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade and others have excellent telephone support, and these people can provide you with specific advice.</p><p>Thanks again for coming aboard. I look forward to becoming a part of your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. </p><p>All the best,</p><p>John Dobosz</p><p>Editor,<strong><em> Forbes Premium Income Report </em></strong></p>",

Our total return sources are options premium, dividends, and capital gains. Options that we sell typically expire 20-60 days after the trade recommendations, usually on the third Friday of the month. Our goal is to earn 2%-5% per month from the trades. On an annualized basis, we target and have achieved returns of 30% and higher.\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true},\"insert\":\"The Buy Write: \"},{\"insert\":\"The bulk of our trades are \"},{\"attributes\":{\"color\":\"\",\"link\":\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\"},\"insert\":\"buy writes\"},{\"insert\":\": buying a stock and simultaneously selling call options against it. The “net debit” is the price of the stock you purchase minus the options premium you earn for selling the calls. In each buy-write each trade recommendation, I provide a suggested net debit to use when placing the trade. \\nOwning the stock allows you to earn dividends, and most of the buy writes I recommend will involve an upcoming dividend. Keep in mind that you will need to own 100 shares of stock for every contract of call options that you sell. Position size is a function of the amount you want to devote to these strategies and your needs for liquidity, but I intentionally keep the average amount of capital required per trade below $5,000 so that as many members as possible can participate. \\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true},\"insert\":\"Selling Puts: \"},{\"insert\":\"A less frequent part of our repertoire is \"},{\"attributes\":{\"color\":\"\",\"link\":\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put?source=fb2f69b5-ad81-47f6-8c9f-c7ebc01664c4\"},\"insert\":\"selling cash-secured puts\"},{\"insert\":\", which generates income when you execute the trade, but it puts you on the hook to buy the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration. If the stock stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it closes below the strike price, you will need to buy 100 shares at that price for every contract of puts you sold. Your broker will require you to have enough cash or margin available to buy the stock when you get into the trade. \\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true},\"insert\":\"Credit Spreads: \"},{\"insert\":\"From time to time, we so do credit spreads, usually a “\"},{\"attributes\":{\"color\":\"\",\"link\":\"https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/bull-put-spread-credit-put-spread\"},\"insert\":\"bull put spread\"},{\"insert\":\",” which involves selling puts at one strike price and buying them at a higher strike price. This generates a “net credit” which is the most you can earn, while the most you can lose is distance between the strike prices minus the net credit. Credit spread trades do not require you to own the underlying stock or to tie up as much capital as writing puts, but losses when they happen can often be 100%. On the other hand, winners often return more than 60%. \\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"bold\":true},\"insert\":\"After Expiration: \"},{\"insert\":\"With buy writes and put writes, we will sometimes own a stock after the options expire.

When our unrealized total return in a position is negative, I like to wait for a price recovery before writing a new round of covered calls or selling the shares. Over extended periods, the dividends help to reduce cost basis, and when trend changes occur, the moves can be large and rapid. \\nWe end up making money on 95% of the closed-out trades, although there can be a bumpy ride before they are closed. Looking back on all our trades since 2014, the positions that really headed south did so after the initial options expired.
