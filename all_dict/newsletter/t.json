    "body": "[id=0]<p>Dear Subscribers,</p><p>I bring good tidings at the beginning of this new year! Our long national nightmare is almost over. If everything goes to plan, you will be able to purchase shares in more than a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs in less than 48 hours. I will be staying on top of everything from here on out to keep you in the loop, but today I wanted to share some responses to common questions that I’ve been getting.</p><p><strong>1) What is the big deal about a spot ETF?</strong></p><p>As all of you know, there are plenty of ways to get spot exposure to bitcoin already. Typically that means buying it directly from an exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, or Robinhood. But these come with some fine print. For one, the fees can be relatively expensive. On the one hand, some spot ETFs will waive fees for the first 6-12 months (more on that in the next section), while exchanges like Coinbase cost an eye-watering 300bps for small retail purchases. Plus as you all know it takes some effort to sign up for an account at one of these exchanges and link a bank account. Spot ETFs will eliminate the need for any of that as you will be able to direct a brokerage account to make an allocation with the click of a button. Second, as we all saw from the collapse of FTX, Voyager, Celsius, BlockFi, and others counterparty risk is a real thing. That will not be an issue in the regulated field of spot bitcoin ETFs, especially when it involves blue chip players like BlackRock and Fidelity.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Didn’t we already have ETFs?</strong></p><p>Yes and no. Investors have been able to purchase cash-settled bitcoin futures ETFs for years. These aim to track the price of bitcoin, but they are not the same thing. A spot ETF will have to physically procure the asset before issuing a share. Futures ETFs just purchase bundles of monthly-settled securities and offer those to investors. No bitcoin actually changes hands. Futures ETFs were a nice way to get some exposure to the sector, and for regulated institutions they were one of the only ways to do it, but these products are not perfect. Besides the expense ratios, ProShares (BITO) product charges almost 100bps and there are additional hidden rollover costs that come when the administrators need to buy the next month’s contracts. During bullish periods futures contracts can start to pull away from the spot price, making it ever more expensive to buy the same amount of contracts in a future month. This condition is called contango, and you can see the effect in the chart below as bitcoin outperformed BITO by more than 20% in the past year.</p>[id=1]<p>During earlier parts of the year when bitcoin’s price was steady, the two assets traded in close proximity with each other. However, when spot ETF excitement really got going in June around the time that BlackRock filed an application, bitcoin began to surge ahead. Spot ETF applications won’t have this issue because the issuers are signing up firms (known as Authorized Participants) such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Virtu, Jane Street, etc that will purchase and redeem shares as necessary to ensure that the assets trade at parity with NAV.</p><p><strong>3) Should I buy an ETF? If so, which one?</strong></p><p>There is a lot to consider. For one, you first need to ask yourself dogmatically how you feel about bitcoin ETFs in general. I know some bitcoin maximalists who feel that ETFs are antithetical to bitcoin’s ethos of self-sovereign money. I understand that point of view in the same way that I can appreciate how other investors do not want to worry about making an error with self-custody and are willing to pay the management fees that pay for piece of mind. That is an individual decision that you will need to make for yourself. </p><p>A couple of other things to consider. First, there is no way to send bitcoin to one of these issuers and get ETF shares in return. You would need to send cash. That means that if just want to convert spot holdings into an ETF you would incur a taxable event and be liabile for income or capital gains tax depending on how long you held the bitcoin. The good news though is that since it is the beginning of 2024 you would not actually need to pay any taxes until 2025. </p><p>The second is fees. They are all over the place. Some issuers such as Invesco, Bitwise, ArkInvest, and WisdomTree are willing to forego fees for six months or until certain AUM thresholds are met. But once you get past that point expense ratios are going to be in the 20-30bps range.</p>[id=2]<p>The big outlier of course is Grayscale, which is at an eye-watering 150bps. This is still a 25% reduction from the current fee, but it is still orders of magnitude higher than the rest of the market. My sense here is that the company is betting on investor apathy or that they will find the higher fee more palatable than the capital gains tax that would otherwise need to be paid. For those of you who own GBTC shares though, I would recommend evaluating cheaper alternatives.</p><p><strong>4) What is going to happen to the price of bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin has a nasty habit of buying rumors and selling news. It happened twice in 2021 when Coinbase went public in April and then futures ETFs began trading in October. </p>[id=3]<p>Will that happen again? It probably depends on how much new money comes in right away. I’ve seen predictions all over the map, and to be honest nobody knows. I do know that the conditions are right for a tight move up should there be a jump. The total amount of bitcon on exchanges is the lowest that it has been in four years, according to data from Glassnode.</p>[id=4]<p>Additionally, ever greater numbers of bitcoin are holding steady. In fact, as you can see in the chart below, more than 80% of all bitcoin has not moved in the last six months. This is the highest reading for this metric in four years as well.</p>[id=5]<p>That said, I would not be surprised if billions do not flow in right away. Some investors and brokerage houses may want to see how these products trade first. Remember, just because the SEC says that these products are now legal does not mean that brokers must support them on day one. </p><p>With that being the case. If new money does not fly in at the start, bitcoin could drag a little. Based on technical charts, which already show bitcoin to be slightly overbought, the next support levels will be around $41,000 and then $33,000. Therefore, given that bitcoin has surged more than 50% over the past few months, you may want to consider taking some profits off of the table with the expectation of buying back in after the dust settles from these expected launches.</p>[id=6]<p>I will be providing you with further updates on all of this throughout the week. As always please feel free to reach out with questions.</p>",
